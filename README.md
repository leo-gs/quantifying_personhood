# Quantifying Personhood
This course syllabus introduces data scientists to qualitative methods and critical perspectives on data. This curriculum is an extension of Jamie Snyder's course of the same name that teaches qualitative and design methods to data scientists. In addition to weekly readings organized by topic, there are two "data workshops" available as Shiny apps that prompt students to apply course topics to real-world data sets.

## Week 1. Course Introduction
_Why do we need qualitative research and critical perspectives?_

_How do truth and objectivity manifest in different research paradigms?_

### Data Workshop
